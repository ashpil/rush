# rush - the really uninteractive shell
Rush is designed to run POSIX scripts, and run them fast. Think of it as a Rust [dash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almquist_shell#dash).

I know that the name is overused, but it's too good to pass up.

- [X] Simple command execution `ls -ltr`

- [X] Variables
- [X] Quotes
- [ ] Functions
- [ ] Control flow `if` `for` `while` `case` etc
- [ ] Expand this to-do list


### Decisions to make

* Should this shell replicate commands that are typically built-in but also have system alternatives?
